# Minovative Mind Features

Minovative Mind is a powerful VS Code extension designed to integrate advanced AI capabilities directly into your development workflow. It leverages Google Gemini models to provide intelligent assistance, automate tasks, and enhance productivity.

## Core AI Capabilities

### AI Chat Interface

- Direct Interaction: Users can chat directly with the AI assistant via a dedicated sidebar view.
- Contextual Awareness: The AI intelligently understands the active file, selected code, current workspace, and relevant project files, providing highly contextual responses to queries.
- General Q&A: Supports general programming questions, debugging help, and conceptual inquiries.

### Contextual Code Explanation

- On-Demand Explanation: Users can select any code snippet in the active editor.
- In-VS Code Notifications: Request an AI explanation via the right-click context menu (`Minovative Mind > Generate Explanation`), and the explanation is delivered concisely in a VS Code modal dialog.

### Intelligent Code Modification & Generation

- Flexible Instructions: Users can select code and provide free-form instructions (e.g., “Refactor this function to use `async/await`”).
- Quick Access: Triggered via a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+M` or `Cmd+M`) or the editor’s right-click context menu (`Minovative Mind > Custom Modifications`).
- AI-Generated Documentation (`/docs`): Typing `/docs` for selected code automatically generates appropriate documentation (e.g., `JSDoc`, `Python docstrings`) and inserts it directly into the file.
- Automated Code Fixing (`/fix`): Typing `/fix` prompts the AI to analyze selected code, including relevant `VS Code` diagnostics (warnings, errors), and propose/apply fixes directly within the editor.
- Modular Code Generation: The AI is explicitly instructed to promote modular code generation principles, encouraging maintainable and scalable solutions.

## Advanced Workflow & Automation

### AI-Driven Planning and Execution

- High-Level Task Breakdown: Users can describe complex development tasks (e.g., “Implement user authentication”) to the AI, and it will break them down into actionable, step-by-step plans. This can be initiated via the chat (`/plan [request]`) or if a direct code modification request is too complex for a single step.
- Two-Stage Planning Process (User Control):
  - Textual Plan Explanation: The AI first presents a human-readable, detailed textual explanation of its proposed plan in the sidebar (formatted with `Markdown`). This allows users to review and understand the AI’s strategy.
  - Structured `JSON` Plan & Execution: Upon user confirmation, the AI converts the textual plan into a machine-readable `JSON` format, which the extension then executes.
- Diverse Plan Step Actions: The AI can plan and execute various actions:
  - `create_directory`: Create new folders at specified relative paths.
  - `create_file`: Create new files, either with static content provided by the AI, or with content generated by the AI based on a prompt.
  - `modify_file`: Modify existing files. The AI uses a `modification_prompt` to generate the updated file content based on the original and instructions. For a given file, all logical changes are combined into a single modification step.
  - `run_command`: Execute shell commands in the integrated terminal (e.g., `npm install`, `git commit`).
- User Confirmation for Commands: For security, users are prompted with a confirmation dialog before any `run_command` step is executed, allowing them to “Allow Command” or “Skip Command”.
- Interactive Execution Feedback: Provides real-time progress updates in `VS Code` notifications and the sidebar chat. Includes a simulated “typing” animation for AI-generated content in the editor.
- Cancellation: Users can cancel an ongoing plan execution at any time via the `VS Code` progress notification.
- Retry Mechanism: If the AI fails to generate a valid `JSON` plan due to parsing errors, a “Retry” option is provided in the sidebar to re-attempt generation.

### Automated Git Commit Messages

- Effortless Commit Messages: Generates descriptive and relevant `Git commit` messages automatically based on staged changes.
- Quick Execution: Can be triggered by typing `/commit` in the chat or clicking a dedicated “Commit Changes” button in the sidebar.
- Streamlined Process: Automatically stages pending changes (`git add .`), analyzes the diff, generates a conventional commit message, and executes the `git commit` command.

## Customization & Management

### Seamless API Key Setup

- Easy Configuration: Users can easily add their `Google Gemini API` keys directly within the `Minovative Mind sidebar`.
- Secure Storage: API keys are securely stored using `VS Code’s` built-in secret storage and are not exposed or sent outside the local environment, except directly to `Google’s Gemini API` endpoints.
- Multi-Key Support: Allows adding and managing multiple API keys.
- Proactive API Key Switching: The extension automatically cycles through configured API keys if one hits a quota limit or encounters other common API errors, ensuring uninterrupted service. Users can also manually switch to the next or previous key, or delete the active key. Also API keys will rotate on every AI API call to distribute cost and usage across all API keys for extreme efficiency. Users can also manually switch to the next or previous key, or delete the active key.

### Flexible AI Model Selection

- User Choice: Select preferred Gemini AI models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`) directly from a dropdown in the sidebar to optimize performance and cost for specific needs.

### Precise Context Control

- Intelligent Filtering: The AI intelligently identifies and provides the most relevant files from the project as context, which is especially beneficial in large codebases.
- Configurable Inclusions/Exclusions: Users can fine-tune the AI’s understanding by explicitly including or excluding specific files or directories from its context in the chat interface, ensuring focused and accurate assistance. This also respects `.gitignore` rules.

## User Experience & Productivity

### Live Code Insertion (Real-time Code Generation)

- Dynamic Typing: When the AI generates file content or modifications as part of a plan, users experience a dynamic, real-time “typing” animation as the code is written into the editor.

### Smart Context Awareness

- Comprehensive Understanding: The AI intelligently considers the `active file content`, `selected code`, relevant `diagnostics` (warnings/errors) from `VS Code`, chat history, and the overall project structure to provide highly relevant and accurate responses.

### Built-in Troubleshooting Guidance

- In-Extension Support: Provides helpful tips and solutions directly within the extension for common issues like API key errors or quota limits, minimizing interruptions.
- External Links: Includes direct links from the settings view to check `Google Cloud API` usage quotas and the Minovative Mind website for additional support.

### Practical Usage Tips

- The extension provides advice on how to effectively prompt the AI and utilize its features to maximize coding productivity, including being specific with prompts and leveraging context.

### Chat History Management

- Persistence: Users can save their entire chat history to a `JSON` file on their local machine for later review or to preserve important discussions/AI-generated content.
- Restoration: Previously saved chat histories can be loaded, providing the AI with context from past conversations for more coherent follow-ups across sessions.
- Clear Chat: Option to clear the current conversation.

### Copy Message Feature

- Convenience: A “Copy Message” button is integrated with AI chat responses, allowing users to easily copy the generated text (including formatted code blocks) to their clipboard.

### Visual Feedback

- Status Updates: Provides clear status messages in the sidebar for ongoing operations (e.g., “`Generating documentation…`”, “`Executing Step 1…`”).
- Error Indicators: Displays distinct visual cues for error messages within the chat and status area.

By combining these features, Minovative Mind aims to provide a comprehensive AI-powered assistant directly within `VS Code`, significantly streamlining development tasks and improving overall developer productivity.
