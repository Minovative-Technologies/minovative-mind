# Minovative Mind Features

Minovative Mind is a powerful VS Code extension designed to integrate advanced AI capabilities directly into your development workflow. It leverages Google Gemini models to provide intelligent assistance, automate tasks, and enhance productivity.

## Core AI Capabilities

### AI Chat Interface

- Direct Interaction: Users can chat directly with the AI assistant via a dedicated sidebar view.
- Contextual Awareness: The AI intelligently understands the active file, selected code, current workspace, and relevant project files, providing highly contextual responses to queries.
- General Q&A: Supports general programming questions, debugging help, and conceptual inquiries.
- Displays relevant file paths within AI chat responses, providing interactive elements to collapse/expand the file list and open files directly.
- Enables HTML rendering in MarkdownIt parser for richer content and updates the 'Generating...' loading message to include an animated ellipsis effect.

### Contextual Code Explanation

- On-Demand Explanation: Users can select any code snippet in the active editor.
- In-VS Code Notifications: Request an AI explanation via the right-click context menu (`Minovative Mind > Generate Explanation`), and the explanation is delivered concisely in a VS Code modal dialog.

### Intelligent Code Modification & Generation

- Flexible Instructions (Premium Tier): Users can select any code snippet or operate on the **entire active file if no selection is present**, and provide free-form instructions (e.g., “Refactor this function to use async/await”).
- Quick Access: Triggered via a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+M` or `Cmd+M`) or the editor’s right-click context menu (`Minovative Mind > Custom Modifications`).
- AI-Generated Documentation (`/docs`): Typing `/docs` for selected code automatically generates appropriate documentation (e.g., `JSDoc`, `Python docstrings`) and inserts it directly into the file.
- Automated Code Fixing (`/fix`) (Premium Tier): Typing `/fix` prompts the AI to analyze selected code, or the **entire active file if no selection is present**, including relevant `VS Code` diagnostics (warnings, errors), and propose/apply fixes directly within the editor.
- **Symbol-Aware Refactoring**: Leverages VS Code's symbol information (functions, classes, variables, references, definitions, and types) to enable more precise, comprehensive, and robust refactorings and modifications across your entire project.
- Modular Code Generation: The AI is explicitly instructed to promote modular code generation principles, encouraging maintainable and scalable solutions
- **Diagnostic-Aware Modifications**: For both targeted selections and whole-file operations, the AI leverages relevant VS Code diagnostics (warnings, errors) to inform its custom modifications, leading to more accurate and problem-solving suggestions.
- AI persona updated to focus on generating production-ready, robust, and secure code.

## Advanced Workflow & Automation

### AI-Driven Planning and Execution

- High-Level Task Breakdown: Users can describe complex development tasks (e.g., “Implement user authentication”) to the AI, and it will break them down into actionable, step-by-step plans. This can be initiated via the chat (`/plan [request]`) or if a direct code modification request is too complex for a single step.
- Two-Stage Planning Process (User Control):
  - Textual Plan Explanation: The AI first presents a human-readable, detailed textual explanation of its proposed plan in the sidebar (formatted with `Markdown`). This allows users to review and understand the AI’s strategy.
  - Structured `JSON` Plan & Execution: Upon user confirmation, the AI converts the textual plan into a machine-readable `JSON` format, which the extension then executes.
- Diverse Plan Step Actions: The AI can plan and execute various actions:

  - `create_directory`: Create new folders at specified relative paths.
  - `create_file`: Create new files, either with static content provided by the AI, or with content generated by the AI based on a prompt.
  - `modify_file`: Modify existing files. The AI uses a `modification_prompt` to generate the updated file content based on the original and instructions. If the target file does not exist, it will be automatically created, with its initial content generated by the AI using the `modification_prompt`. This enhances the robustness of the action. For a given file, all logical changes are combined into a single modification step.
  - `run_command`: Execute shell commands in the integrated terminal (e.g., `npm install`, `git commit`).

- User Confirmation for Commands: For security, users are prompted with a confirmation dialog before any `run_command` step is executed, allowing them to “Allow Command” or “Skip Command”.
- Interactive Execution Feedback: Provides real-time progress updates in `VS Code` notifications and the sidebar chat. Includes a simulated “typing” animation for AI-generated content in the editor.
- **File Diffs in Chat**: Displays real-time file changes (diffs) directly within the chat interface for `create_file` and `modify_file` plan steps, with enhanced execution messages indicating diff availability.
- Cancellation: Users can cancel an ongoing plan execution at any time via the `VS Code` progress notification.
- **Resilient Plan Execution**: Enhances robustness by automatically retrying failed plan steps (with 10s, 15s, 20s delays) for transient errors like API overloads or network issues. For persistent failures or exhausted retries, users are prompted with options to 'Retry Step', 'Skip Step', or 'Cancel Plan', preventing mid-plan halts and preserving progress.
- Retry Mechanism: If the AI fails to generate a valid `JSON` plan due to parsing errors, the system will automatically retry plan generation up to **3 times** (as defined by `MAX_PLAN_PARSE_RETRIES`). A “Retry” option is also provided in the sidebar for manual re-attempts.
- **Dynamic Context Awareness:** The AI maintains a robust and adaptive understanding of ongoing project changes, including newly created files and recent modifications, throughout a multi-step workflow. This ensures that subsequent planned actions are highly coherent and build accurately upon previous steps, leading to more reliable and contextually aware solutions that reflect the evolving state of your codebase.
- **Seamless Editor-to-Plan Integration**: When custom code modification requests (triggered via `Ctrl+M` or `Cmd+M`) or `/fix` commands involve complex, multi-step tasks, the extension seamlessly escalates them to the full AI-driven planning and execution system. This allows the AI to break down and execute the task as a coherent series of actions, potentially across multiple files, to achieve the desired outcome.

### Automated Git Commit Messages

- Effortless Commit Messages: Generates descriptive and relevant `Git commit` messages automatically based on staged changes.
- Quick Execution: Can be triggered by typing `/commit` in the chat or clicking a dedicated “Commit Changes” button in the sidebar.
- Streamlined Process: Automatically stages pending changes (`git add .`), analyzes the diff, generates a conventional commit message, and executes the `git commit` command.
- Interactive Review: A user-facing review step is provided for generated Git commit messages before they are actually executed, allowing users to approve or modify.

## Account & Subscription Management

### User Accounts & Authentication

- **Seamless Integration:** A dedicated 'Sign In' button triggers a command that guides users to the Minovative Mind settings panel, allowing them to effortlessly authenticate their Minovative Mind account directly within VS Code.
- **Secure Sessions:** The extension securely manages user authentication sessions, enabling personalized feature access and preferences.

### Flexible Subscription Tiers

## Customization & Management

### Seamless API Key Setup

- Easy Configuration: Users can easily add their `Google Gemini API` keys directly within the `Minovative Mind sidebar`.
- Secure Storage: API keys are securely stored using `VS Code’s` built-in secret storage and are not exposed or sent outside the local environment, except directly to `Google’s Gemini API` endpoints.
- Multi-Key Support: Allows adding and managing multiple API keys.
- Proactive API Key Switching: The extension automatically cycles through configured API keys if one hits a quota limit or encounters common API errors, ensuring uninterrupted service. Additionally, keys will rotate on every AI API call to distribute cost and usage for efficiency. Users can also manually switch to the next or previous key, or delete the active key.

### Flexible AI Model Selection

- User Choice: Select preferred Gemini AI models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`) directly from a dropdown in the sidebar to optimize performance and cost for specific needs.

### Precise Context Control

- Intelligent Filtering: The AI intelligently identifies and provides the most relevant files from the project as context, which is especially beneficial in large codebases.
- Configurable Inclusions/Exclusions: Users can fine-tune the AI’s understanding by explicitly including or excluding specific files or directories from its context in the chat interface (by telling it what to in/exclude). This also respects `.gitignore` rules.

## User Experience & Productivity

### Live Code Insertion (Real-time Code Generation) (Premium Tier)

- Dynamic Typing: When the AI generates file content or modifications as part of a plan, users experience a dynamic, real-time “typing” animation as the code is written into the editor. This feature is exclusive to the Premium Tier.

### Smart Context Awareness

- **Comprehensive Understanding**: The AI intelligently considers the active file content, selected code, relevant diagnostics (warnings/errors) from VS Code, chat history, the overall project structure, enhanced detailed symbol information (definitions, references), and TypeScript-aware dependency graph analysis (respecting `tsconfig.json`/`jsconfig.json` for accurate module resolution), to provide highly relevant and accurate responses.

### Built-in Troubleshooting Guidance

- In-Extension Support: Provides helpful tips and solutions directly within the extension for common issues like API key errors or quota limits, minimizing interruptions.
- External Links: Includes direct links from the settings view to check `Google Cloud API` usage quotas and the Minovative Mind website for additional support.

### Practical Usage Tips

- The extension provides advice on how to effectively prompt the AI and utilize its features to maximize coding productivity, including being specific with prompts and leveraging context.

### Chat History Management

- Persistence: Users can save their entire chat history, including displayed file diffs, to a `JSON` file on their local machine for later review or to preserve important discussions/AI-generated content.
- Restoration: Previously saved chat histories can be loaded, providing the AI with context from past conversations for more coherent follow-ups across sessions. Chat history also automatically restores to the webview following actions like commit confirmation, cancellation, and plan execution updates.
- Clear Chat: Option to clear the current conversation.

### Copy Message Feature

- Convenience: A “Copy Message” button is integrated with AI chat responses, allowing users to easily copy the generated text (including formatted code blocks) to their clipboard.

### Visual Feedback

- Status Updates: Provides clear status messages in the sidebar for ongoing operations (e.g., “`Generating documentation…`”, “`Executing Step 1…`”).
- Error Indicators: Displays distinct visual cues for error messages within the chat and status area.
- **Code Block Rendering**: Ensures code blocks displayed in the chat (e.g., within AI responses or diffs) are properly word-wrapped to prevent horizontal scrolling and improve readability.
- **Diff Syntax Highlighting**: File diffs displayed in the chat interface are rendered with syntax highlighting for added and removed lines, enhancing clarity and reviewability.

By combining these features, Minovative Mind aims to provide a comprehensive AI-powered assistant directly within `VS Code`, significantly streamlining development tasks and improving overall developer productivity.
