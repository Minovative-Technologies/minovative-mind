## ‚ú® Key Features

Minovative Mind is designed to streamline your coding tasks and boost productivity with cutting-edge AI capabilities:

- **Intelligent AI Chat:**

  - Engage directly with the AI assistant in a dedicated sidebar.
  - Benefit from contextual awareness, where the AI understands your active file, selected code, workspace, and relevant project files.
  - Ask general programming questions, debug issues, or inquire about concepts.
  - Now displays relevant file paths within chat responses, allowing users to collapse/expand the file list and open files directly.

- **Contextual Code Explanation:**

  - Select any code snippet and instantly get a concise, AI-generated explanation via the right-click context menu (`Minovative Mind > Generate Explanation`).

- **Intelligent Code Modification & Generation:**

  - Select code and provide free-form instructions (e.g., "Refactor this function," "Add input validation") (Premium Tier Feature).
  - Trigger via keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+M` / `Cmd+M`) or context menu (`Minovative Mind > Custom Modifications`) (Premium Tier Feature).
  - AI persona updated to focus on generating production-ready, robust, and secure code.
  - **Automated Documentation (`/docs`):** Type `/docs` for selected code to automatically generate and insert appropriate documentation (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings).
  - **Automated Code Fixing (`/fix`):** Type `/fix` to prompt the AI to analyze selected code (including VS Code diagnostics like errors/warnings) and propose/apply fixes directly in the editor (Premium Tier Feature).

- **Advanced AI-Driven Planning and Execution: (Premium Tier Feature)**

  - Describe complex development tasks (e.g., ‚ÄúImplement user authentication‚Äù) to the AI, and it will break them down into actionable, step-by-step plans.
  - **User-Controlled Two-Stage Process:** Review a detailed textual plan in the sidebar before confirming for the AI to execute it.
  - **Diverse Actions:** Plans can include creating directories, creating files (with AI-generated content), modifying existing files, and running shell commands (with user confirmation for security). It now handles non-existent files by automatically creating them and populating their initial content using the provided 'modification_prompt'.
  - Enhances real-time execution messages to indicate diff availability for file operations.

- **Automated Git Commit Messages:**

  - Generate descriptive and conventional Git commit messages automatically based on your staged changes by typing `/commit` in the chat or clicking a dedicated button.

- **Seamless API Key Management & Model Selection:**

  - Easily add and manage your Google Gemini API keys directly within the sidebar. Keys are securely stored and cycled automatically if limits are hit.
  - Distribute usage and manage costs very efficiently with the automatic cycling system that cycles through your API keys, ensuring even consumption and enhanced resilience.
  - Select your preferred Gemini AI models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`) for optimized performance and cost.

- **Smart Context Awareness:**
  - The AI intelligently identifies and leverages the most relevant files from your project, including overall project structure, TypeScript-aware module resolution for enhanced dependency parsing, detailed symbol information, selected code, diagnostics, and chat history for highly accurate and idiomatic responses. You can also configure inclusions/exclusions.
