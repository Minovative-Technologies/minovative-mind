## Contributing

We welcome and appreciate contributions from the community! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these guidelines.

To propose changes or add new features, the standard workflow is to **fork the repository**.

Forking creates a personal copy of the project under your own account. This allows you to experiment freely, develop features, or fix bugs without impacting the original project directly.

**Contribution Workflow:**

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button on the project's page (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your newly created fork to your local development environment:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME.git
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `PROJECT_NAME` accordingly).
3.  **Create a Feature Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch for your specific contribution:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your feature or fix the bug. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices.
5.  **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your work descriptively:
    ```bash
    git commit -m 'feat: Add new feature X'
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git commit -m 'fix: Resolve bug Y'
    ```
6.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your fork on the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: Navigate back to the original project repository and open a new Pull Request from your fork's branch. Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes, explaining the problem it solves or the feature it adds.

**Best Practices:**

Please ensure your changes are well-documented and include relevant tests if applicable. Consider syncing your fork with the main repository regularly (`git pull upstream main`) before submitting your PR.

For more detailed instructions on forking and pull requests, please refer to the platform's documentation (e.g., [GitHub Docs: Forking a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)).
