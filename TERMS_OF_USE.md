## Last Updated: September 15, 2025

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to the Minovative Mind VS Code Extension ("Minovative Mind" or "the Extension"), a powerful AI coding agent designed to enhance your development workflow within Visual Studio Code. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Minovative Mind extension provided by Minovative Technologies DBA ("we," "us," or "our").

By installing, accessing, or using the Minovative Mind extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md), our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE.md) under which the core software is distributed. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Extension.

## 2. Description of the Minovative Mind Extension

Minovative Mind is an open-source AI agent that automates various aspects of software development. It leverages advanced AI models (specifically the Google Gemini API, which requires your own API key) to assist with tasks such as generating code, planning projects, fixing issues, explaining code, and automating Git operations. The Extension processes local user data and interacts with external AI APIs using user-provided keys.

## 3. User Responsibilities

As a user of the Minovative Mind extension, you agree to the following responsibilities:

### 3.1 API Key Management and Costs

You are solely responsible for obtaining, securing, and managing your own Google Gemini API key. Minovative Technologies DBA does not store, transmit, or have access to your API key, which is managed exclusively by VS Code’s secure SecretStorage API on your local machine. You are responsible for all costs and usage associated with your Google Gemini API key, and for complying with Google’s own terms of service and privacy policies for their AI services.

### 3.2 Responsibility for Input and Output

You are solely responsible for all content you provide to the Minovative Mind extension, including text prompts, selected code, uploaded images (processed as Base64 data), and URLs. You are also solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and deploying any code, plans, or other outputs generated by the AI. You acknowledge that AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or contain errors, and you must exercise your own judgment and expertise when utilizing such output.

### 3.3 Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Minovative Mind extension in compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations. You further agree to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which outlines expectations for respectful and collaborative engagement. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:

- Using the Extension for any illegal, harmful, or unethical activities.
- Generating or promoting content that is infringing, defamatory, obscene, or harmful.
- Attempting to circumvent any security features or access unauthorized data.
- Using the Extension to generate malicious code or engage in hacking activities.

### 3.4 Local Data and Environment Security

The Minovative Mind extension primarily operates on your local machine and processes your workspace data locally. You are responsible for the security of your local development environment, including your VS Code installation, project files, and network connections. We are not responsible for any security breaches or data loss originating from your local environment.
