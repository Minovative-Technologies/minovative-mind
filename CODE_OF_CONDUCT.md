# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Minovative Mind project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.
- Maintaining a collaborative and open spirit, recognizing that both human ingenuity and AI assistance are vital to the Minovative Mind project's success.
- Engaging in technical discussions and code reviews with a focus on improving the project's quality and functionality for everyone.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
- Any behavior that undermines the collaborative and respectful environment that Minovative Mind strives to foster.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The Minovative Mind project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Minovative Mind project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the Minovative Mind project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team responsible for enforcement in this form [Google Form](https://forms.gle/GkVPGxMNY7xcgndF9). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
