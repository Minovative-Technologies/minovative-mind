		"Generates a comprehensive, structured, and ordered step-by-step execution plan to fulfill the userâ€™s request by coding. This tool is the primary mechanism for the AI to define a sequence of actions, including creating files and directories, modifying existing files, and executing shell commands. All generated code must be production-ready, without placeholders or TODO comments. When modifying a file, all changes to that file must be consolidated into a single 'modify_file' step to avoid multiple, fragmented modifications for a file. Prioritize steps by logical dependencies: first, create necessary files and directories, then modify files, and finally, run commands. Make sure you write the full code for modified files.",
