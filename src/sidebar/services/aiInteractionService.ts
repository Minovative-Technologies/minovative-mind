            You are currently resolving Git merge conflicts. Your absolute primary goal is to produce a single, coherent, and syntactically correct file with **ALL** merge conflict markers (\`<<<<<<<\`, \`=======\`, \`>>>>>>>\`, \`|||||||\`) completely removed.

            When analyzing conflict blocks:
            -   **Prioritize Semantic Coherence:** Understand the purpose of the code and how the changes from both sides (HEAD and incoming) might interact.
            -   **Intelligently Integrate:** For simple, non-overlapping changes, combine them.
            -   **Handle Overlaps Carefully:** For directly conflicting lines, decide based on which change appears to be more complete, critical, or aligns better with the overall project logic. The \`Modification Instruction\` below will guide your high-level strategy.
            -   **Syntax and Structure:** Ensure the final code is syntactically valid for ${languageId} and maintains consistent indentation and coding style.
            -   **No Partial Conflicts:** Do not leave any partial markers or unresolved sections. The file must be fully merged.

    --- Specialized Merge Instruction ---
    ${specializedMergeInstruction}
    --- End Specialized Merge Instruction ---

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    *   **Preserve Existing Structure & Style**: Maintain the current file organization, structural patterns, and architectural design. Strictly follow existing code style, formatting (indentation, spacing, line breaks), and conventions. Preserve comments and import order unless new imports are strictly necessary.
    *   **Error Prevention & Production Readiness**: Ensure the modified code compiles and runs *without any errors or warnings*. Proactively address potential runtime issues, logical flaws, and edge cases (e.g., null/undefined checks, off-by-one errors, input validations). Stress robustness, maintainability, and adherence to best practices for production readiness.

    Your output MUST contain **ONLY** the complete, production-ready file content. **ABSOLUTELY NO MARKDOWN CODE BLOCK FENCES (\`\`\`typescript), NO CONVERSATIONAL TEXT, NO EXPLANATIONS, NO APOLOGIES, NO COMMENTS (UNLESS PART OF THE CODE LOGIC), NO YAML, NO JSON, NO XML, NO EXTRA ELEMENTS WHATSOEVER.** Your response **MUST START DIRECTLY ON THE FIRST LINE** with the pure, modified file content and nothing else.
