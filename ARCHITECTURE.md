   - **Key Files**: `src/sidebar/managers/chatHistoryManager.ts`.
   - **AI Usage**: No

9. **Chat Interaction & Response**:

   - **Responsibility**: Orchestrates the user's general conversational experience with the AI, including receiving user messages, integrating various contextual data (like URL context), and managing the AI's textual responses for display in the chat interface.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/chatService.ts`.
   - **AI Usage**: Yes

10. **Workspace File Scanning**:

    - **Responsibility**: Efficiently scans the VS Code workspace to discover and identify relevant project files and directories, respecting `.gitignore` rules, applying size and type filters, and utilizing caching for performance.
    - **Key Files**: `src/context/workspaceScanner.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: No

11. **Code & Project Structure Analysis**:

    - **Responsibility**: A collection of services dedicated to deeply understanding the project's codebase, including extracting document symbols, fetching and formatting diagnostic information (errors, warnings), detecting the project's technology stack/type, and building the internal dependency graph between files.
    - **Key Files**: `src/services/symbolService.ts`, `src/utils/diagnosticUtils.ts`, `src/services/projectTypeDetector.ts`, `src/context/dependencyGraphBuilder.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: No

12. **Intelligent Context Selection & Assembly**:

    - **Responsibility**: Determines the most relevant portions of the project (specific files, code snippets, summaries, active symbols) to provide as context to the AI. This system employs both heuristic (rule-based) and AI-driven (smart) selection strategies, and then assembles this disparate information into a cohesive, token-optimized prompt string. Includes a sequential processing mode for very large contexts.
    - **Key Files**: `src/services/contextService.ts`, `src/context/heuristicContextSelector.ts`, `src/context/smartContextSelector.ts`, `src/context/fileContentProcessor.ts`, `src/context/contextBuilder.ts`, `src/services/sequentialContextService.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: Yes

13. **External URL Content Fetching**:

    - **Responsibility**: Specializes in retrieving and formatting content from external URLs (e.g., documentation pages, Stack Overflow links) to enrich the context provided to the AI.
    - **Key Files**: `src/services/urlContextService.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: No

14. **AI Planning Engine (Structured)**:

    - **Responsibility**: Focuses on the AI's ability to generate, parse, and validate multi-step action plans in a structured (e.g., JSON) format, ensuring the generated plan adheres strictly to the predefined schema. This is the "brain" responsible for creating the executable strategy.
    - **Key Files**: `src/ai/workflowPlanner.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: Yes

15. **Plan Execution & Workflow Automation**:

    - **Responsibility**: Interprets and executes the concrete steps defined in an AI-generated structured plan.

    - **AI Usage**: Yes

16. **Enhanced Code Generation & Self-Correction**:

    - **Responsibility**: A sophisticated system dedicated to generating, modifying, and refining code files. It incorporates real-time validation against VS Code's language services (diagnostics), and employs iterative AI-driven self-correction loops to produce functional, error-free, and well-formatted code.
    - **Key Files**: `src/ai/enhancedCodeGeneration.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: Yes

17. **Git Integration & Automation**:

    - **Key Files**: `src/utils/parallelProcessor.ts`.
    - **AI Usage**: No

20. **AI Prompt Management & Engineering**:
    - **Responsibility**: This system is responsible for the definition, generation, structuring, and management of prompts sent to the AI models, ensuring they are contextually relevant, effectively formatted, and aligned with specific AI tasks.
    - **Key Files and Components**:
      - Prompt Definition & Templates: `src/ai/prompts/` (e.g., `correctionPrompts.ts`, `enhancedCodeGenerationPrompts.ts`, `lightweightPrompts.ts`, `planningPrompts.ts`)
      - Task-Specific Prompt Generation: `src/ai/enhancedCodeGeneration.ts` (`EnhancedCodeGenerator` class's role in creating prompts for code generation and self-correction tasks)
