## The [Creator](https://github.com/Quarantiine) himself intelligently vibe coded these systems below mostly using the AI agent itself to build the monolithic application you see below

### Core Extension (Foundation)

1. **VS Code Extension Core**:

   - **Responsibility**: Handles the main VS Code extension lifecycle, including activation, deactivation, and registration of top-level commands that initiate workflows. It serves as the entry point and orchestrator for the extension's overall functionality.
   - **Key Files**: `src/extension.ts`
   - **Uses AI**: No

2. **Sidebar UI & Communication**:

   - **Responsibility**: Manages the webview-based sidebar interface. This includes its rendering, handling all user interactions within the sidebar (e.g., chat input, button clicks, settings changes), and establishing the crucial bidirectional communication channel between the extension's backend (TypeScript) and the webview frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). It also ensures the preservation and restoration of relevant UI states for a continuous user experience across sessions.
   - **Key Files**: `src/sidebar/SidebarProvider.ts`, `src/sidebar/ui/webviewHelper.ts` (and implied `src/services/webviewMessageHandler.ts`).
   - **Uses AI**: No

3. **Application Configuration Management**:

   - **Responsibility**: Manages user-specific settings and preferences for the extension. This involves loading default configuration values, persisting user-made changes across VS Code sessions, and providing a centralized access point for other components to retrieve configured values (e.g., AI model preferences, context building parameters).
   - **Key Files**: `src/sidebar/managers/settingsManager.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: No

4. **AI API Key Management**:
   - **Responsibility**: Securely handles the storage, retrieval, and validation of API keys required for accessing AI services (specifically Google Gemini APIs). It ensures that API keys are managed safely and are readily available for AI requests when needed, abstracting the complexities of credential management from other parts of the system.
   - **Key Files**: `src/sidebar/managers/apiKeyManager.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: No

### AI Services (Core AI Interaction)

1. **AI Model Integration (Gemini Client)**:

   - **Responsibility**: Provides the low-level, direct interface for communicating with the Google Gemini API. This includes handling API initialization, managing streaming responses from the model, performing basic error mapping for common API issues, and accurately counting tokens for both input prompts and generated responses. It supports various Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-pro`, `flash`, `flash-lite`). Users can input their own API key to utilize these services. The client now supports configuring the `FunctionCallingMode` for API requests, enhancing control over AI interaction behavior.
   - **Key Files**: `src/ai/gemini.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (direct API calls).

2. **AI Request Orchestration & Robustness**:

   - **Responsibility**: Manages the overall process of making AI requests with a focus on reliability and efficiency. It implements robust **retry logic** for transient network errors, API rate limits, or service unavailability, and handles **cancellation requests** allowing users to terminate ongoing AI operations. It also orchestrates and optimizes concurrent AI calls through **parallel processing and batching** via integration with `src/utils/parallelProcessor.ts`, and reports token usage to `src/services/tokenTrackingService.ts`. This system acts as a critical abstraction layer over the direct API client, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance. Specifically, `aiRequestService.generateFunctionCall` now accepts and forwards the `functionCallingMode` parameter, which is leveraged to enforce `FunctionCallingMode.ANY` for plan generation workflows. This requires careful adjustment of argument passing, including the cancellation token, to ensure correct handling of this mode.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/aiRequestService.ts` (`AIRequestService` class, `generateWithRetry`, `generateMultipleInParallel`, `generateInBatches`, `processFilesInParallel`).
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (orchestrates all direct AI calls).

3. **Token Usage Tracking**:

   - **Responsibility**: Monitors and tracks the consumption of AI tokens across different types of AI requests. It provides real-time and aggregate usage statistics to the user, offering transparency and insights into AI service costs.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/tokenTrackingService.ts`
   - **Key Methods**: `trackTokenUsage` (records token usage for each request), `getTokenStatistics` (calsulates total, average, and grouped statistics by request type and model), `estimateTokens` (provides heuristic token estimation for text content for real-time streaming updates), `getRealTimeTokenEstimates`, `getCurrentStreamingEstimates`, `onTokenUpdate`, `triggerRealTimeUpdate`, `clearTokenHistory`, `getFormattedStatistics`.
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (directly involved in tracking AI model usage).

4. **AI Prompt Management & Engineering**:

   - **Responsibility**: This system is central to effective communication with AI models. It is responsible for the definition, dynamic generation, structuring, and precise management of prompts sent to the AI. It ensures that prompts are contextually relevant, effectively formatted (e.g., using specific delimiters, incorporating structured data), and meticulously aligned with specific AI tasks (e.g., planning, code generation, summarization).
   - **Key Files and Components**:
     - Prompt Definition & Templates: `src/ai/prompts/` (e.g., `correctionPrompts.ts`, `enhancedCodeGenerationPrompts.ts`, `lightweightPrompts.ts`, `planningPrompts.ts`).
     - Task-Specific Prompt Generation: `src/ai/enhancedCodeGeneration.ts` (`EnhancedCodeGenerator` class's role in creating prompts for code generation and modification), `src/services/sequentialFileProcessor.ts` (for file summarization prompts).
     - Workflow Planning Prompts: `src/services/planService.ts` (generating planning-related prompts, e.g., `createInitialPlanningExplanationPrompt`, `createPlanningPrompt`).
     - AI Request Interface: `src/services/aiRequestService.ts` (functions as the primary interface for sending prepared prompt content, often as `HistoryEntryPart` arrays, to the AI model, including prompt encapsulation and transmission).
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (directly structures input for AI).

5. **AI Code Quality Assurance**:
   - **Responsibility**: Ensures the quality, correctness, and adherence to formatting standards of code generated or modified by AI models. This system, primarily implemented in `src/services/codeValidationService.ts`, integrates directly with VS Code's diagnostic capabilities to identify syntax errors, unused imports, security vulnerabilities, and best practice violations. It also implements custom validation rules for code structure, including specific delimiter checks, serving as a crucial quality gatekeeper for all AI-generated code within the platform.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/codeValidationService.ts` (`CodeValidationService` class, `validateCode`, `checkPureCodeFormat`).
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (directly validates AI outputs).

### Context Management (Project Understanding)

1. **Workspace File Scanning**:

   - **Responsibility**: Efficiently scans the VS Code workspace to discover and identify relevant project files and directories. It rigorously respects `.gitignore` rules, applies configurable size and file type filters (supporting user-defined relevant file extensions), and allows for the provision of custom ignore patterns for granular control over the scan scope. It also utilizes caching for performance optimization.
   - **Key Files**: `src/context/workspaceScanner.ts` (`scanWorkspace`, `clearScanCache`, `getScanCacheStats`).
   - **Uses AI**: No

2. **Code & Project Structure Analysis**:

   - **Responsibility**: A collection of services dedicated to deeply understanding the project's codebase. This includes:
     - Extracting Document Symbols: `src/services/symbolService.ts` provides functions to retrieve detailed symbol information (classes, functions, variables, etc.) from files.
     - Fetching & Formatting Diagnostic Information: `src/utils/diagnosticUtils.ts` retrieves and formats real-time diagnostic data (errors, warnings, info, hints) from VS Code, often contextualizing it around selected code.
     - Detecting Project Type: `src/services/projectTypeDetector.ts` analyzes project manifests (e.g., `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`) and file structures to detect the project's primary language, framework, and type (e.g., frontend, backend, library, CLI).
     - Building Dependency Graph: `src/context/dependencyGraphBuilder.ts` analyzes import/export statements to build forward and reverse dependency graphs between files, providing insight into code relationships.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/symbolService.ts`, `src/utils/diagnosticUtils.ts`, `src/services/projectTypeDetector.ts`, `src/context/dependencyGraphBuilder.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: No (provides foundational data for AI context).

3. **Context Building & Selection**:

   - **Responsibility**: Orchestrates the entire process of building semantic-aware and highly relevant contextual data for AI models from the user's project. This sophisticated system employs a multi-faceted approach:
     - **Orchestration**: `src/services/contextService.ts` is the central coordinator, integrating outputs from various sub-components. It also manages performance monitoring (`PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS`) to identify and log slow context-building phases.
     - **File Content Summarization**: `src/context/fileContentProcessor.ts` intelligently summarizes file content, prioritizing active symbols, important definitions, and imports, while respecting configurable token limits.
     - **Heuristic Selection**: `src/context/heuristicContextSelector.ts` applies rule-based scoring (e.g., proximity to active file, call hierarchy, direct/reverse dependencies) to quickly identify strong candidates for inclusion.
     - **Smart AI-Driven Selection**: `src/context/smartContextSelector.ts` refines heuristic results by using an AI model to make nuanced relevance decisions based on detailed symbol information and file summaries, including caching AI selection results.
     - **Context Assembly**: `src/context/contextBuilder.ts` (using `DEFAULT_CONTEXT_CONFIG`) assembles all disparate information (file structure, recent changes, file paths, symbol info, active symbol details, file contents) into a cohesive, token-optimized prompt string, adhering to configurable token limits. It constructs and includes an `ActiveSymbolDetailedInfo` structure capturing comprehensive details about the symbol at the cursor (definition, implementations, type definitions, references, call hierarchy, children hierarchy).
     - **Large Context Handling**: `src/services/sequentialContextService.ts` provides a sequential processing mode for very large codebases to efficiently analyze and summarize files in batches, preventing memory and token overflow, especially useful when deep understanding of numerous files is required. It now leverages **workspace dependency computation and caching** (from `dependencyGraphBuilder.ts`) and integrates these file dependency graphs to enhance its context selection and refinement.
       `src/services/sequentialFileProcessor.ts` works in conjunction with it, employing **internal file caching** to improve performance, generating **richer context and stricter output format for AI analysis prompts**, implementing **detailed file complexity estimation** using multiple metrics, **enhanced main purpose detection** based on path and extension, **expanded and refined dependency extraction** from code, and **refined relevance scoring** for prior file context, considering dependencies and user intent.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/contextService.ts`, `src/context/contextBuilder.ts`, `src/context/fileContentProcessor.ts`, `src/context/heuristicContextSelector.ts`, `src/context/smartContextSelector.ts`, `src/services/sequentialContextService.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (for smart context selection and for sequential context processing/summarization).

4. **URL Context Retrieval**:
   - **Responsibility**: Automatically identifies URLs within user input (e.g., chat messages) and fetches their content to provide additional contextual information for AI models.
   - **Key Methods**: `extractUrls` (for regex-based URL extraction from text), `fetchUrlContext` (for performing HTTP requests to retrieve content, handling various content types like HTML and plain text, and managing errors), `parseHtmlContent` (for stripping HTML tags, normalizing whitespace, and extracting titles from fetched HTML), and `formatUrlContexts` (for presenting the retrieved URL information in a structured, AI-readable format for inclusion in prompts).
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/urlContextService.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: No (prepares external web content as context for AI).

### Code Generation & Modification

1. **Enhanced Code Generation & Modification**:
   - **Responsibility**: Orchestrates advanced AI-driven code generation and modification workflows. It exposes core public methods: `generateFileContent` for creating entirely new files and `modifyFileContent` for intelligently updating existing files. Both methods support **streaming responses** for real-time user feedback. A critical feature is its integrated **validation loop**, which leverages `src/services/codeValidationService.ts` to ensure generated code meets quality, correctness, and formatting standards. It also uses `src/utils/codeAnalysisUtils.ts` for file structure analysis (e.g., `analyzeFileStructure`) and `src/utils/codeUtils.ts` for tasks like stripping markdown fences (`cleanCodeOutput`) and applying precise text edits (`applyAITextEdits`). The internal `_generateInitialContent` and `_modifyFileContentFull` methods handle the core AI interaction and multi-step refinement.
   - **Key Files**: `src/ai/enhancedCodeGeneration.ts` (`EnhancedCodeGenerator` class).
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (generates and modifies code, leveraging AI feedback).

### Plan & Workflow Management

1. **Workflow Planning Structure**:

   - **Responsibility**: Defines the strict schema, type guards, and initial validation rules for AI-generated multi-step execution plans. This system ensures that the AI's output is structured, machine-readable, and executable by the extension.
   - **Key Files**: `src/ai/workflowPlanner.ts`
   - **Key Interfaces/Enums**: `PlanStepAction` (enum defining allowed actions: `create_directory`, `create_file`, `modify_file`, `run_command`), `PlanStep` (base interface for any step), `CreateDirectoryStep`, `CreateFileStep`, `ModifyFileStep`, `RunCommandStep` (specific step types extending `PlanStep` with action-specific properties), `ExecutionPlan` (overall plan structure containing `planDescription` and an array of `steps`).
   - **Key Functions**: `isCreateDirectoryStep`, `isCreateFileStep`, `isModifyFileStep`, `isRunCommandStep` (type guards for runtime validation), `parseAndValidatePlan` (parses a raw JSON string into an `ExecutionPlan` object, performing comprehensive validation including adherence to schema, relative path safety, and `.gitignore` checks).
   - **Uses AI**: No (defines the structure for AI outputs).

2. **Plan Service & Execution Orchestration**:

   - **Responsibility**: Manages the full lifecycle of AI-generated action plans, from initial conceptualization to automated execution and post-execution handling. This includes:
     - **Initial Plan Generation**: Uses lightweight AI models (Gemini Flash Lite) via `src/services/aiRequestService.ts` to generate high-level textual plan explanations based on user requests and project context (`createInitialPlanningExplanationPrompt`).
     - **Structured Planning**: Utilizes `createPlanningPromptForFunctionCall` to guide the AI, via `aiRequestService.ts`, to convert textual explanations into detailed, multi-step executable JSON plans. For this, `FunctionCallingMode.ANY` is specifically applied to force the AI to generate a `generateExecutionPlan` tool call, ensuring a deterministic JSON output that strictly adheres to the schema defined in `src/ai/workflowPlanner.ts`. This strategic use of 'ANY' mode is crucial for the reliability of automated planning.
     - **Validation & Repair**: Employs `parseAndValidatePlanWithFix` (which wraps `parseAndValidatePlan` from `workflowPlanner.ts`) to rigorously validate generated plans against the schema, including programmatic repair for common JSON escape sequence errors that AI models might introduce. With `FunctionCallingMode.ANY` now enforcing a tool call for planning, the focus of validation shifts more heavily towards the content and structure of the `functionCall.args` (the JSON plan) itself, ensuring it's syntactically correct and semantically valid, rather than primarily checking if a function call was made. `parseAndValidatePlanWithFix` and its underlying repair mechanisms remain critical for handling any malformed JSON arguments.
     - **Step Execution Logic**: Interprets and executes each concrete step of the structured plan (e.g., `_handleCreateDirectoryStep`, `_handleCreateFileStep`, `_handleModifyFileStep`, `_handleRunCommandStep`), managing step-level retries for transient errors and providing user intervention options (retry, skip, cancel).
     - **File System & Code Integration**: Directly utilizes `enhancedCodeGenerator` (from `src/ai/enhancedCodeGeneration.ts`) for AI-driven file creation and modification, `gitConflictResolutionService.ts` for automated conflict resolution in specific scenarios, `commandExecution.ts` for securely running shell commands (with user confirmation), and `ProjectChangeLogger.ts` for meticulously recording all file modifications.
     - **User Interaction**: Manages user prompts for command execution confirmation, provides real-time progress updates (`_logStepProgress`), handles comprehensive error reporting (`_reportStepError`), and notifies the user upon plan completion or cancellation. It also tracks and persists the overall execution outcome and changes for review and potential reversion.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/planService.ts` (`PlanService` class, `handleInitialPlanRequest`, `initiatePlanFromEditorAction`, `generateStructuredPlanAndExecute`, `_executePlan`, `_executePlanSteps`, `parseAndValidatePlanWithFix`), `src/ai/workflowPlanner.ts`, `src/services/aiRequestService.ts`, `src/ai/enhancedCodeGeneration.ts`, `src/services/gitConflictResolutionService.ts`, `src/utils/commandExecution.ts`, `src/workflow/ProjectChangeLogger.ts`.
   - **Uses AI**: Yes (for initial textual plan, structured plan generation, and code generation/modification within plan steps).

3. **Project Change Logging**:

   - **Responsibility**: Provides a comprehensive, auditable log of all file system modifications (creations, modifications, deletions) performed by AI-driven workflows. It meticulously tracks individual changes (`FileChangeEntry`) during an active plan execution and then archives them into `RevertibleChangeSet` objects upon successful plan completion, ensuring a traceable and reversible development process.
   - **Key Files**: `src/workflow/ProjectChangeLogger.ts`
   - **Key Structures**: `FileChangeEntry` (records `filePath`, `changeType`, `summary`, `diffContent`, `timestamp`, `originalContent`, `newContent` for individual file changes), `RevertibleChangeSet` (groups related `FileChangeEntry` objects for a single completed plan execution, along with a unique `id` and `summary`).
   - **Key Methods**: `logChange` (adds individual changes to the current in-memory log buffer), `getChangeLog` (retrieves the current set of changes), `clear` (resets the current log buffer), `saveChangesAsLastCompletedPlan` (transfers current changes to an archived `RevertibleChangeSet` and clears the buffer), `getCompletedPlanChangeSets` (retrieves all archived change sets), `popLastCompletedPlanChanges` (removes the most recent archived set from the stack), `clearAllCompletedPlanChanges`).
   - **Uses AI**: No (records actions taken by the system, not directly by AI).

4. **Reversion Service**:
   - **Responsibility**: Provides critical functionality for safely undoing file system changes made by AI-driven workflows. It accesses detailed logs of created, modified, and deleted files through `src/workflow/ProjectChangeLogger.ts`, using the stored `originalContent` (or lack thereof) to restore the project state.
   - **Key Methods**: The core `revertChanges` method iterates through a provided list of `FileChangeEntry` objects in reverse chronological order. For 'created' files, it deletes them; for 'modified' files, it restores their `originalContent`; and for 'deleted' files, it recreates them with their `originalContent`. It handles file system errors and provides user notifications.
   - **Key Files**: `src/services/RevertService.ts` (`RevertService` class).
   - **Uses AI**: No.
